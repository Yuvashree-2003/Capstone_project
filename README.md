Fitness Tracker

A MERN-stack fitness tracker app.

Description:
The Fitness Tracker is a web application that enables users to sign in and record their fitness activities. Each fitness record includes the duration of the workout, the type of workout selected from a dropdown list, and the intensity level (slow, medium, intense). The date of the activity defaults to the current date but can be edited if necessary. Based on the input provided, the application calculates and displays the calories burned for an average person. After logging in, users can view their fitness history, which includes the recorded dates, and have the ability to delete their records, allowing them to maintain an accurate log of their fitness progress over time.
